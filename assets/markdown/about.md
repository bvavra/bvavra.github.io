## As an Accordionist

Brendan bought his first accordion when he was 16 at a flea market for $100.  Once he learned his first tune he knew this was the instrument for him - it was the most fun he's had playing any other instrument.

Since then Brendan has explored various musical styles and genres on the accordion, from Irish folk, to Klezmer, to Jazz.  Primaily he loves to play video game music, which encompasses a wide variety of styles and evokes a great sense of nostalgia in listeners, as well as himself.
