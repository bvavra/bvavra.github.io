## As an Accordionist

I bought my first accordion when I was 16 at a flea market for $100, and once I learned my first tune I knew this was the instrument for me - the accordion is the most fun I've had playing any musical instrument, and that's still true to this day.

Over the years I've explored various musical styles and genres on the accordion, from Irish folk, to Klezmer, to Jazz.  I love to play video game music the most because it encompasses a wide variety of styles and evokes a great sense of nostalgia in listeners such as myself.  It also requires a bit of creativity to arrange these tunes for accordion, which allows for unique exploration of patterns and textures not commonly heard on the instrument.
