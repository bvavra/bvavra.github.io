## As a Composer

I've always been very musically self-driven, and once I got my hands on music notation software in early high school, the world of composition completely opened up to me in a way I never thought would be possible.  

I started off writing pop rock songs, then later moved on to concert band VGM arrangements.  Eventually I started writing original concert band pieces, one of which was used in my [high school's marching band show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYH70PT9Aw) and ended up winning the 2004 Atlantic Coast Championships and the award for Best Music.  This opportunity gave me the ambition to pursue an education in music composition, which I did at Ithaca College, where I received my Bachelors of Music in 2010.  

Admittedly, I haven't done much composing since then, but that can change in the future.
