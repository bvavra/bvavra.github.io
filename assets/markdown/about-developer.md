## As a Developer

I've been working as a professional software developer for over 10 years, specializing in SaaS platform architecture and agile development processes.  My primary focus has been in .NET/C# and Oracle, building services using WebApi, Entity Framework, and .NET OData.  I've also done a handul of front-end work using various JavaScript libraries such as jQueryUI, ExtJS, and Angular.

I'm passionate about achieving and maintaining code scalability, readability, and testability using object-oriented programming best practices and test-driven design principles.  At the same time, I've learned to take a less abolute and more pragmatic approach to development in order to maximize functional output without over-engineering solutions, as well as balancing short and long term goals to optimize the combined value of both.

I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from Ithaca College in 2010.  From there I spent two years in San Diego, CA working at Localeze (now Neustar Information Services) as a .NET developer working on local search data solutions.  It was there that I learned the fundamentals of Agile processes and Test-Driven Developement.

In 2012 I moved back to Ithaca, NY to join ChemSW, where I've been working on material inventory management software ever since.  Between then and now, ChemSW was aquired by Accelrys, who shortly thereafter was acquired by Dassault Systemes and rebranded as BIOVIA.  I now lead a team of developers and work with other BIOVIA teams to build integrated lab solutions for a variety of industries.

I also continue to dabble in various side projects in my free time, some of which you can check out on my [Projects page.](./projects)
