<!-- TODO: About Page Items:
    - write up a bio.  consider professional development vs music persona, etc.
    - determine if we want landing page links to other pages and, if so, decide if this is redundant with the home page.
    -- I think it makes sense to keep this page and have this be the wordier bio section.
       The home page should be less-wordy, more "check stuff out!"" clickable things
