<!-- TODO:
- decide what I actually want to put here:
-- Do I want landing-page buttons that mimic (and highlight options in) the nav menu?
-- Do I want to dynamically add social media feeds (Twitter/IG) or maybe highlight latest YT/SC upload?
-- Do I want a list of most recent blog posts like the current Jekyll site? (would I really blog?)
- If I blog (or even if I decide not to), should we look into supporting rendering markdown files?
-- ngx-markdown works!  See https://jfcere.github.io/ngx-markdown/get-started for docs
-- see https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown for details.
