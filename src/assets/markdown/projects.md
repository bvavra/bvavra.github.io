## This Website

Originally [bvavra.github.io](http://bvavra.github.io/) was built using Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template.  I liked the style, but wanted to build my own site using Angular, so I ported the styles and rebuilt all of the desired site components in Angular from the ground-up.
